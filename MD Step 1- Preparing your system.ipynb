    "\n",
    "1. Do you want to simulate a system that has a ligand bound or unbound? If you have a ligand you will need to include additional force field parameters in following steps. A number of small organic molecules have been previously parameterized, so you will have to see if that is the case for your ligand. If it is not, you will need to develop the parameters. There are numerous methods to do this. I have used RESP before, but I'm not totally convinced it's the best way. Either way, if you parameterize something you should include that information in your SI!!! \n",
    "    \n",
    "    RESP: [Bayly:93:10269-10280] C. I. Bayly et. al. J. Phys. Chem. 97, 10269 (1993)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a) if you are keeping a ligand, you should save the ligand coordinates in SDF format, and delete it from the PDB file. At this point you need to separate protein and non-protein molecules (except ions and water) because they will get different treatment in later steps. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is there a mutation in the crystal structure? Pretty common. Easy fix, just delete the atoms that are not in the residue you want to be there, and change the three letter residue ID. A program used in later steps will be able to identify there are missing atoms in that residue and place them. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Are there missing residues or heavy atoms? Probably, but it is only an issue if there are consecutive missing residues. There are programs that exist to try and predict positions of missing residues if this is the case. https://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Are there ions or cofactors present that you don't want to simulate? Probably. Just remove those lines from the pdb file. \n",

    "    \n",
    "5. Do you want to keep crystallographic waters? Probably. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Visualize your system (PyMol and VMD are my go-tos). See if anything looks wrong. For example, there should only be 1 of your system. In some crystallizations there are repeating units. Unless you intentially want to simulate repeating units (which you probably don't) delete the lines in the PDB file associated with repeats. \n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Add 'TER' lines to the PDB. 'TER' separates parts in the PDB file that are not covalently linked. If you have a dimer protein you should have two TER lines after the carboxylic acid terminal oxygens. You don't need to add TER between water molecules, tleap will do that for you.\n",

I like to protonated my system and then load it into a visualization software to evaluate protonation states, specifically of all HIS residues. Histidine's have two nitrogen atoms that can be protonated, and it will depend on the enrivornment which is more likely the be protonated. It is best practice to manually visualize each HIS residue and declare the protonation state.\n",

You also need to delete the HE2 hydrogen atom line. When you load the pdb into tleap again it will detect there needs to be a HD2 atom added, and will do so automatically because you named that residue HID. \n",

This is an annoying feature of tleap. You should keep this in mind when trying to calculate how many ions you need for a particular ionic concentration.

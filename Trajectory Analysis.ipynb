    "ioutfm = 1 flag tells AMBER to write the trajetory in the format of NetCDF (binary, with the typical .nc extension), but some visualization softwares can't read this format (like PyMol, for example) or VMD if you have a newer MacBook Pro that required the 64-bit updated VMD package- I think there may be a bug in their NetCDF plug in, but if you're using an older version it will probably work). \n",

    "> autoimage anchor :1-454 #SUPER important! This will fix any strange visual effects arising from periodic boundary conditions, like bond wrapping. The anchor tells the command what components should be held fixed in position, and orient mobile molecules (like waters and ions) around that position. I chose all the residues of my protein, to ensure the whole protein is centered. If you don't give an anchor I think the default is the first atom or residue in the file, and this can still lead to visualization artifacts if not all your residues are bonded together- so like if you have a dimer! You also need to be aware that it takes the position of your anchor in the first frame... so If your molecule is centered in that frame then the rest of the trajectory will not be cenered in reference to the box. This works fine if you sequentially do this to all your trajectory, starting with traj1 which probably hasn't had the chance to drift much... but if you are just looking at one trajectory you may want to do an alignment (see below).\n",
